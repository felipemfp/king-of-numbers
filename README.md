# Experimento: Numbers

Chopsticks (also called Numbers, Swords, Sticks, Fingers, Magic Fingers, Split, Cherries, Sharks, and Bananas) is a hand game for two players, in which players extend a number of fingers from each hand and transfer those scores by taking turns to tap one hand against another. One player can pause game for however long they want. Only he can I pause the game. However that player can only pause the game for a maximum of 1 hour. The basic version is an example of a solved game in that so long as both players play optimally, the game's victor can be predicted at any point.¹
